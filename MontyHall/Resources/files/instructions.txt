Instructions

The game show host presents the participant with three closed doors and tells the participant that behind one of the doors is a prize, behind the other two doors are goats.

The game show host then asks the participant to choose a door.
Once the participant has chosen a door the game show host then opens one of the other doors behind which is a goat.
The game show host then asks the participant if they want to hold with the door they have chosen or to swap and open the other closed door.

This app contains two main sections:

Play game - where you can play the Monty Hall game one game at a time.

Run game simulation - where you can play a number of games using a particular strategy(hold/swap/random), in order to discover how many games you can with with the strategy selected. 
You will be limited to 10 million simulations, this should however be enough to get a good sense of the probabilities involved in the game.

What do you think is the best strategy for winning the prize?
Should you hold, swap or is your chance of winning equal whichever choice you make?

The simulation will help you gather evidence for which is the best strategy.
